# Depression-Detection
1. Collaborated as a team member on a project focused on depression detection using deep learning techniques.
2. Collected and processed video data to extract facial frames and Action Units (AUs) for emotional feature analysis.
3. Assisted in the creation of a structured dataset by organizing extracted frames and AU features for model training and validation.
4. The developed dataset is currently under review for publication and will be made publicly available for academic research.
5. Experimented with multiple machine learning models(e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, XGBoost) and deep learning models (e.g., CNN variants) to identify the most accurate and reliable architecture.
